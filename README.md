I created a Kanban (project management tool).

Key Features of My Kanban Tool:-

1. Add Tasks: Quickly create new tasks.
2. Delete Tasks: Easily remove tasks.
3. Drag and Drop: Smooth drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks across columns (To-Do, In-Progress, Done).
4. Real-Time Updates
5. Local Storage Support: Tasks remain saved even after refreshing or closing the browser.
